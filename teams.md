NextPlex Mobile
=============
We're building a dedicated mobile app on top of the existing NextPlex.com platform.

NextPlex was born in Rochester, to unite developers and creatives at events just like this one, to come together and build the future in cities big and small.

We believe that any city can be a hub of innovation, creativity and high-technology. Innovators are everywhere, we just need to find each other. Human ingenuity is unlimited and the places where we invent together can be too.

NextPlex Mobile will focus on events, allowing potential collaborators to communicate back-channel, share opinions, research potential collaborators, meetup and plan projects.

CreepChat
=============
This mobile app facilitates the sharing of snapshots that people take with
randomly selected other users. The idea is to feel a connection with an unknown
person as they share a snapshot of their life with you. "Sharing sessions"
could be restricted or encourages at a particular time of day in order to
better create a sense of solidarity between total and utter strangers. Perhaps
certain themes could be applied to any given "sharing session". Ultimately, the
hope is that people from completely different geographical locations and/or
demographics will be able to share in a moment of connectivity through the
sharing of imagery.
