<h1>Existing Apps</h1>
<h2><img src="https://raw2.github.com/rochestercivicappchallenge/resources/master/badges/attroc-gold-display.png" /> NextPlex Mobile</h2>
We're building a dedicated mobile app on top of the existing NextPlex.com
platform.

NextPlex was born in Rochester, to unite developers and creatives at events
just like this one, to come together and build the future in cities big and
small.

We believe that any city can be a hub of innovation, creativity and
high-technology. Innovators are everywhere, we just need to find each other.
Human ingenuity is unlimited and the places where we invent together can be
too.

NextPlex Mobile will focus on events, allowing potential collaborators to
communicate back-channel, share opinions, research potential collaborators,
meetup and plan projects.

Busme! Rochester
----------------
Building Busme! Rochester based on Busme!'s system.  See more about Busme! [http://busme.us](http://busme.us).

We use Busme!'s tools to create a Busme! Plan file for a couple Rochester Bus lines. A Busme!
Plan File is a zip file containing bunch of CSV and KML files. These files represent the paths,
routes, and schedules of bus lines.

All we really need to do this is public bus schedules with route maps on them, and may be some
intricate knowledge of the system, if the maps are vague.

We will create a Busme! Transit Site for Rochester and model several bus lines. And with any 
luck we will get some people to ride the buses with their Android phones and report their GPS
locations for the bus that they are riding.

The Busme! philosophy is based on civic duty and as such we are currently looking for a 
Rochester resident, preferebly one who actually rides the bus and knows
its system somewhat to join the team.

CreepChat
---------
This mobile app facilitates the sharing of snapshots that people take with
randomly selected other users. The idea is to feel a connection with an unknown
person as they share a snapshot of their life with you. "Sharing sessions"
could be restricted or encourages at a particular time of day in order to
better create a sense of solidarity between total and utter strangers. Perhaps
certain themes could be applied to any given "sharing session". Ultimately, the
hope is that people from completely different geographical locations and/or
demographics will be able to share in a moment of connectivity through the
sharing of imagery.
