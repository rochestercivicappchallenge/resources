Hackathon Teams

remotely, or join a team after the hackathon.

demo time!

NextPlex Mobile
=============
We're building a dedicated mobile app on top of the existing NextPlex.com platform.

NextPlex was born in Rochester, to unite developers and creatives at events just like this one, to come together and build the future in cities big and small.

We believe that any city can be a hub of innovation, creativity and high-technology. Innovators are everywhere, we just need to find each other. Human ingenuity is unlimited and the places where we invent together can be too.

NextPlex Mobile will focus on events, allowing potential collaborators to communicate back-channel, share opinions, research potential collaborators, meetup and plan projects.
