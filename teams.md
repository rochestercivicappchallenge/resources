Hackathon Teams

This page is here to serve as a resource for those who want to participate
remotely, or join a team after the hackathon.

It will also serve as a way for teams to list themselves for presentations at
demo time!

CreepChat
=============
This mobile app facilitates the sharing of snapshots that people take with randomly selected other users. The idea is to feel a connection with an unknown person as they share a snapshot of their life with you. "Sharing sessions" could be restricted or encourages at a particular time of day in order to better create a sense of solidarity between total and utter strangers. Perhaps certain themes could be applied to any given "sharing session". Ultimately, the hope is that people from completely different geographical locations and/or demographics will be able to share in a moment of connectivity through the sharing of imagery.
